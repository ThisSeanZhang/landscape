# Landscape - Linux Router Configuration Tool

**Landscape** is a tool with a web-based UI that allows you to configure your favorite `Linux distribution` as a `router` easily.

> Built with Rust / eBPF / AF_PACKET.

## Startup and Limitations

### System Requirements
- Supported Linux kernel version: `6.1` or higher.

### Startup Steps
1. Create the configuration folder:
   ```shell
   mkdir -p ~/.landscape-router
   ```
2. Place the `geosite.dat` file into the above folder.

3. Start the service:
   After compiling, run the following command to start the service (default port: `6300`):
   ```shell
   ./landscape-webserver
   ```

## Compilation

### Dependencies Installation
Ensure the following dependencies are installed:
```shell
apt install pkg-config bpftool build-essential clang libelf1 libelf-dev zlib1g-dev
```

### Compilation Steps
Make sure `node`, `yarn`, and `rust` are installed, then run the following command to compile:
```shell
./build.sh
```

The compiled output will be located in the `output` folder.

## Help Wanted

1. **PPPoE MTU Issues**
   - Observed packets exceeding MTU size, likely caused by `GRO` or `GSO`. Disabling the feature increases NIC load. Currently, using `pppd` avoids the issue.
   - Relevant code reference: [PPPoE egress implementation](https://github.com/ThisSeanZhang/landscape/blob/424b842c29c469e4ad14503ee2bf9190ee24fd11/landscape/landscape-ebpf/src/bpf/pppoe.bpf.c#L68-L74)

2. **Container DNS Issues**
   - When a container sets the host as the DNS server, `dig` works correctly, but `curl` fails to resolve hosts. The issue does not occur on the host system.

3. **Code Structure Issues**
   - The code structure is currently unorganized, requiring better modularization.
